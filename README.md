## 10. DATA TRANSFORMATION


   In Power Query Editor,

   
  •	To facilitate easy dashboard creation, merged the four datasets into one unified dataset, enabling streamlined analysis and visualization. This consolidated 
    dataset enhances data coherence and simplifies the dashboard creation process.

    
  •	Transformed the abbreviations in the "size" column into descriptive names, enhancing comprehension and usability of the dataset. This modification improves 
    clarity and facilitates easier interpretation of the pizza sizes.

    S >> Small
   
    M >> Medium
   
    L  >> Large
   
    XL >> X-Large
   
    XXL >> XX-Large
   

   •	Implemented a custom column named "Total_price" by multiplying the "quantity" with the "unit_price," enhancing the dataset's clarity and facilitating 
      straightforward calculation of total prices for each item.


   •	Implemented DAX measures to calculate key metrics such as Total Revenue and Average Order Value , providing valuable insights into sales performance. These 
      measures enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on accurate and easily accessible financial information.  


## 11. BUILDING DASHBOARD


  Developed two dynamic dashboards in Power BI to cater to distinct business needs:


  •	The first dashboard features essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), including Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, and Total pizzas sold, 
    alongside insightful charts displaying busiest days and times, as well as sales performance trends over specific time periods. This dashboard empowers 
    stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize operational efficiency and strategic decision-making.


•	The second dashboard highlights best and worst-selling pizzas through visually engaging charts and tables, providing a comprehensive overview of pizza sales 
  performance. By leveraging intuitive visuals and comparative analysis, this dashboard facilitates informed product management strategies and enables targeted 
  marketing efforts to drive sales growth.
